The disadvantages of clicking a mouse button are that it may not be as natural, spontaneous, and variable as flexing a finger or wrist, and that it may involve more muscles and brain regions than flexing a finger or wrist.

Finally, because the movement is small, it can be difficult to register the EMG onset if the participant does not conduct the movement rapidly enough or if the electrodes are not attached precisely.\n",
